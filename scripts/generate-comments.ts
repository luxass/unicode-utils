I have a Unicode Character Database (UCD) file. Your task is to extract the heading (header section) from this file.

A heading in a UCD file:
- Starts at the beginning of the file
- Contains comment lines (lines starting with #)
- Ends when one of these is encountered:
  1. A data line (any line that is neither a comment nor empty) - this ALWAYS marks the end of a heading
  2. A boundary line (comment lines with multiple #, -, or = characters in a row) ONLY if it's not followed by more comment lines
  3. A line starting with "# Property" or "# @missing" - these special comment lines mark the end of the heading section
- If the file doesn't contain ANY comment lines starting with #, then there is NO heading, and the result should be empty

Here are the first ${MAX_LINES} lines of the file:

\`\`\`
${limitedContent}
\`\`\`

Please extract ONLY the heading content from this file. Do not include any data lines or content after the heading ends. Do not add any explanatory text - just return the exact heading content as it appears in the file.

Important rules:
- If you see patterns like "# ######" or "# ------" or "# ======", these are boundary markers, but they only end the heading if they're NOT followed by more regular comment lines.
- If a boundary marker is followed by more comment lines, the heading continues until another ending condition is met.
- Any data line (non-comment, non-empty line) immediately ends the heading.
- Lines beginning with "# Property" or "# @missing" mark the end of the heading and should not be included.
