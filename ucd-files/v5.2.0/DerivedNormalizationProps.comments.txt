# Derived Property: FC_NFKC_Closure
#  Generated from computing: b = NFKC(Fold(a)); c = NFKC(Fold(b));
#  Then if (c != b) add the mapping from a to c to the set of
#  mappings that constitute the FC_NFKC_Closure list
#  Uses the full case folding from CaseFolding.txt, without the T option.

# Derived Property:   NFKC_Casefold (NFKC_CF)
#   This property removes certain variations from characters: case, compatibility, and default-ignorables.
#   It is used for loose matching and certain types of identifiers.
#   It is constructed by applying NFKC, CaseFolding, and removal of Default_Ignorable_Code_Points.
#   The process of applying these transformations is repeated until a stable result is produced.
#   WARNING: Application to STRINGS must apply NFC after mapping each character, because characters may interact.
#            For more information, see [http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/]
# Omitted code points are unchanged by this mapping.
