#
# Format:
# <string> (# <comment>)? 
#  <string> contains hex Unicode code points, with 
#	÷ wherever there is a break opportunity, and 
#	× wherever there is not.
#  <comment> the format can change, but currently it shows:
#	- the sample character name
#	- (x) the Grapheme_Cluster_Break property value for the sample character
#	- [x] the rule that determines whether there is a break or not
#
# These samples may be extended or changed in the future.
