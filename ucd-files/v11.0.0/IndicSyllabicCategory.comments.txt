# This file defines the following property:
#
#    Indic_Syllabic_Category     enumerated property
#
# Scope: This property is aimed at two general problem
# areas involving the analysis and processing of Indic scripts:
#
#   1. Specification of syllabic structure.
#   2. Specification of segmentation rules.
#
# Both of these problem areas may benefit from having defined subtypes
# of Indic script characters which are relevant to how Indic
# syllables (or aksaras) are constructed. Note that rules for
# syllabic structure in Indic scripts may differ significantly
# from how phonological syllables are defined.
#
# Format:
#    Field 0  Unicode code point value or range of code point values
#    Field 1  Indic_Syllabic_Category property value
#
# Field 1 is followed by a comment field, starting with the number sign '#',
# which shows the General_Category property value, the Unicode character name
# or names, and, in lines with ranges of code points, the code point count in
# square brackets.
#
# The scripts assessed as Indic in the structural sense used for the
# Indic_Syllabic_Category are the following:
#
# Ahom, Balinese, Batak, Bengali, Bhaiksuki, Brahmi, Buginese, Buhid,
# Chakma, Cham, Devanagari, Dogra, Grantha, Gujarati, Gunjala Gondi,

# Tagalog, Tagbanwa, Tai Le, Tai Tham, Tai Viet, Takri, Tamil,
# Telugu, Thai, Tibetan, Tirhuta, and Zanabazar Square.
#
# All characters for all other scripts not in that list
# take the default value for this property, unless they
# are individually listed in this data file.
