# Specification of the variation sequences that are defined in the
# Unicode Standard.
#
# This file is a normative contributory data file in the
# Unicode Character Database.
#
# Standardized variation sequences are defined in this file.
#
# Ideographic variation sequences are defined according to the registration
# process specified in UTS #37, and are listed in the Ideographic
# Variation Database.
#
# Emoji variation sequences are defined in the file
# emoji-variation-sequences.txt, documented in UTS #51, Unicode Emoji.
#
# Only those three types of variation sequences
# are sanctioned for use by conformant implementations.
# In all other cases, use of a variation selector character does
# not change the visual appearance of the preceding base character
# from what it would have had in the absence of the variation selector.
#
# For more information on standardized variation sequences,
# see Section 23.4, Variation Selectors,
# in The Unicode Standard, Version 11.0.
