# Provisional Unicode Named Character Sequences
#
# Note: This data file contains those named character
#   sequences which have been designated to be provisional,
#   rather than fully approved.
#
# Format:
# Name of Sequence; Code Point Sequence for USI
#
# Code point sequences in the Unicode Character Database
# use spaces as delimiters. The corresponding format for a
# UCS Sequence Identifier (USI) in ISO/IEC 10646 uses
# comma delimitation and angle brackets. Thus, a Unicode
# named character sequence of the form:
#
# EXAMPLE NAME;1000 1001 1002
#
# in this data file, would correspond to an ISO/IEC 10646 USI
# as follows:
#
# <1000, 1001, 1002>
#
# For more information, see UAX #34: Unicode Named Character
# Sequences, at https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr34/
#
# Note: The order of entries in this file is not significant.
# However, entries are generally in script order corresponding
# to block order in the Unicode Standard, to make it easier
# to find entries currently in the list.
