# This file is a normative contributory data file in the

#
# This file defines the Joining_Type and Joining_Group property
# values for Arabic, Syriac, N'Ko, Mandaic, and Manichaean positional
# shaping, repeating in machine readable form the information
# exemplified in various tables of The Unicode Standard core specification.
#
# This file also defines Joining_Type values for
# Mongolian, Phags-pa, Psalter Pahlavi, Sogdian, Old Uyghur, Chorasmian,
# and Adlam positional shaping,
# and Joining_Type and Joining_Group values for Hanifi Rohingya positional shaping,
# which are not listed in tables in the core specification.

# Each line contains four fields, separated by a semicolon.
#
# Field 0: the code point of a character, in hexadecimal form.
#
# Field 1: gives a short schematic name for that character.
#   The schematic name is descriptive of the shape, based as
#   consistently as possible on a name for the skeleton and
#   then the diacritic marks applied to the skeleton, if any.
#   Note that this schematic name is considered a comment,
#   and does not constitute a formal property value.
#
# Field 2: defines the joining type (property name: Joining_Type)
#   R Right_Joining
#   L Left_Joining
#   D Dual_Joining
#   C Join_Causing
#   U Non_Joining
#   T Transparent
#
# See Section 9.2, Arabic for more information on these joining types.
# Note that for cursive joining scripts which are typically rendered
# top-to-bottom, rather than right-to-left, Joining_Type=L conventionally
# refers to bottom joining, and Joining_Type=R conventionally refers
# to top joining. See Section 14.4, Phags-pa for more information on the
# interpretation of joining types in vertical layout.
#
# Field 3: defines the joining group (property name: Joining_Group)
#
# The values of the joining group are based schematically on character
# names. Where a schematic character name consists of two or more parts
# separated by spaces, the formal Joining_Group property value, as specified in
# PropertyValueAliases.txt, consists of the same name parts joined by
# underscores. Hence, the entry:
#
#   0629; TEH MARBUTA; R; TEH MARBUTA
#
# corresponds to [Joining_Group = Teh_Marbuta].
#
# Note: The property value now designated [Joining_Group = Teh_Marbuta_Goal]
#   used to apply to both of the following characters
#   in earlier versions of the standard:
#
#   U+06C2 ARABIC LETTER HEH GOAL WITH HAMZA ABOVE
#   U+06C3 ARABIC LETTER TEH MARBUTA GOAL
#
#   However, it currently applies only to U+06C3, and *not* to U+06C2.
#   To avoid destabilizing existing Joining_Group property aliases, the
#   prior Joining_Group value for U+06C3 (Hamza_On_Heh_Goal) has been
#   retained as a property value alias, despite the fact that it
#   no longer applies to its namesake character, U+06C2.
#   See PropertyValueAliases.txt.
#
# When other cursive scripts are added to the Unicode Standard in the
# future, the joining group value of all its letters will default to
# jg=No_Joining_Group in this data file. Other, more specific
# joining group values will be defined only if an explicit proposal
# to define those values exactly has been approved by the UTC. This
# is the convention exemplified by the N'Ko, Mandaic, Mongolian,
# Phags-pa, Psalter Pahlavi, Sogdian, Old Uyghur, Chorasmian, and Adlam scripts.
# Only the Arabic, Manichaean, and Syriac scripts currently have
# explicit joining group values defined for all characters, including
# those which have only a single character in a particular Joining_Group
# class. Hanifi Rohingya has explicit Joining_Group values assigned only for
# the few characters which share a particular Joining_Group class, but
# assigns jg=No_Joining_Group to all the singletons.
#
# Note: Code points that are not explicitly listed in this file are
# either of Joining_Type T or U:
#
# - Those that are not explicitly listed and that are of General_Category Mn, Me, or Cf
#   are Joining_Type=T.
# - All others not explicitly listed are Joining_Type=U.
#
# For an explicit listing of all characters of Joining_Type=T, see
# the derived property file DerivedJoiningType.txt.
# For an implementation that needs to parse for the values of
# Joining_Type, it is recommended to use DerivedJoiningType.txt
# instead of ArabicShaping.txt, to avoid the separate required step of
# calculating the set for Joining_Type=T based on General_Category values.
