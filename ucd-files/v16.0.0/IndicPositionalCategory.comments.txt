# This file defines the following property:
#
#    Indic_Positional_Category     enumerated property
#
# Scope: This property is aimed at the problem of
# the specification of syllabic structure for Indic scripts.
# Because dependent vowels (matras), visible viramas, and other
# characters are placed in notional slots around the consonant (or
# consonant cluster) core of an Indic syllable, there may be
# cooccurrence constraints or other interactions. Also, it may be
# desirable, in cases where more than one such character may occur in
# sequence, as for example, in a top slot and a bottom slot, to
# specify preferred orders for spelling. As such, this property
# is designed primarily to supplement the Indic_Syllabic_Category
# property.
#
# In addition to combining marks associated with Indic scripts, the
# Indic_Positional_Category has non-trivial values for special signs
# associated with Indic_Syllabic_Category=Consonant_Prefixed
# or Indic_Syllabic_Category=Consonant_Preceding_Repha. Those signs
# have General_Category=Lo, rather than being combining marks.
# They occur in initial position in syllabic structure. However, when
# rendered, they appear as marks positioned with respect to another
# base letter (usually above it). Hence, having an explicit value for
# Indic_Positional_Category for those signs can be helpful.
#
# Note that this property is *not* intended as
# a prescriptive property regarding display or font design,
# for a number of reasons. Good font design requires information
# that is outside the context of a character encoding standard,
# and is best handled in other venues. For Indic dependent
# vowels and similar characters, in particular:
#
#   1. Matra placement may vary somewhat based on typeface design.
#   2. Matra placement, even within a single script, may vary
#      somewhat according to historic period or local conventions.
#   3. Matra placement may be changed by explicit orthographic reform
#      decisions.
#   4. Matras may ligate in various ways with a consonant (or even
#      other elements of a syllable) instead of occurring in a
#      discrete location.
#   5. Matra display may be contextually determined. This is
#      notable, for example, in the Tamil script, where the shape
#      and placement of -u and -uu vowels depends strongly on
#      which consonant they adjoin.
#
# Format:
#    Field 0  Unicode code point value or range of code point values
#    Field 1  Indic_Positional_Category property value
#
# Field 1 is followed by a comment field, starting with the number sign '#',
# which shows the General_Category property value, the Unicode character name
# or names, and, in lines with ranges of code points, the code point count in
# square brackets.
#
# The scripts assessed as containing dependent vowels or similar characters
# in the structural sense used for the Indic_Positional_Category are the
# following:
#
# Ahom, Balinese, Batak, Bengali, Bhaiksuki, Brahmi, Buginese, Buhid,
# Chakma, Cham, Devanagari, Dives Akuru, Dogra, Grantha, Gujarati,
# Gunjala Gondi, Gurmukhi, Gurung Khema, Hanunoo, Javanese, Kaithi,
# Kannada, Kawi, Kayah Li, Kharoshthi, Khmer, Khojki, Khudawadi,
# Kirat Rai, Lao, Lepcha, Limbu, Makasar, Malayalam, Marchen,
# Masaram Gondi, Meetei Mayek, Modi, Myanmar, Nandinagari, Newa,
# New Tai Lue, Oriya, Rejang, Saurashtra, Sharada, Siddham, Sinhala,
# Soyombo, Sundanese, Syloti Nagri, Tagalog, Tagbanwa, Tai Tham,
# Tai Viet, Takri, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Tibetan, Tirhuta,
# Tulu-Tigalari, and Zanabazar Square.
#
# All characters for all other scripts not in that list
# take the default value for this property.
#
# See IndicSyllabicCategory.txt for a slightly more extended
# list of Indic scripts, including those which do not have
# positional characters. Currently, those additional
# Indic scripts without positional characters are
# Multani, Phags-pa, and Tai Le.
#
# Notes:
#
# 1. The following characters are all assigned the positional category Right,
# but may have different positions in some cases:
#   * U+0BC1 TAMIL VOWEL SIGN U and U+0BC2 TAMIL VOWEL SIGN UU have
#     contextually variable placement in Tamil.
#   * U+11341 GRANTHA VOWEL SIGN U and U+11342 GRANTHA VOWEL SIGN UU have
#     contextually variable placement in Grantha.
#   * U+11440 NEWA VOWEL SIGN O and U+11441 NEWA VOWEL SIGN AU have contextually
#     variable placement in Newa.
#
# 2. The following characters are all assigned the positional category Top,
# but may have different positions in some cases:
#   * U+1143E NEWA VOWEL SIGN E and U+1143F NEWA VOWEL SIGN AI have contextually
#     variable placement in Newa.
#
# 3. The following characters are all assigned the positional category Bottom,
# but may have different positions in some cases:
#   * U+0D41 MALAYALAM VOWEL SIGN U and U+0D42 MALAYALAM VOWEL SIGN UU form
#     complex ligatures with consonants in older Malayalam orthography, and
#     are spacing marks to the right of the base in reformed Malayalam
#     orthography.
#   * U+102F MYANMAR VOWEL SIGN U and U+1030 MYANMAR VOWEL SIGN UU have
#     contextually variable placement in Myanmar.
#   * U+1A69 TAI THAM VOWEL SIGN U and U+1A6A TAI THAM VOWEL SIGN UU have
#     contextually variable placement in Tai Tham.
#   * U+113BB TULU-TIGALARI VOWEL SIGN U and
#     U+113BC TULU-TIGALARI VOWEL SIGN UU form complex ligatures with
#     consonants.
#
# 4. The following character is assigned the positional category Left, but
# may have different positions in different styles:
#   * U+119D2 NANDINAGARI VOWEL SIGN I has stylistically variable placement
#     in Nandinagari.

# Property: Indic_Positional_Category
#
#  All code points not explicitly listed for Indic_Positional_Category
#  have the value NA (not applicable).

# Indic_Positional_Category=Right
# Indic_Positional_Category=Left
# Indic_Positional_Category=Visual_Order_Left
# These are dependent vowels that occur to the left of the consonant
# letter in a syllable, but which occur in scripts using the visual order
# model, instead of the logical order model. Because of the different
# model, these left-side vowels occur first in the backing store (before
# the consonant letter) and are not reordered during text rendering.
