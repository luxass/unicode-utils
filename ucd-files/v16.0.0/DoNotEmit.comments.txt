# Do_Not_Emit
#
# This file is part of the Unicode Character Database. It does not define
# any properties, but rather provides additional information about
# characters or character sequences that should not be emitted or generated
# in newly authored text. Applications such as input methods could use this
# information to replace "Do Not Emit" sequences input by users with an
# acceptable alternative. Other applications may use the information in
# this file to consider certain sequences similar to each other for display,
# collation, or searching purposes. (This is an addition to canonical
# equivalence, which is defined elsewhere in the standard.)
#
# Note that the discouraged sequences listed in this file should not be
# considered invalid input to text display implementations. When received
# by an implementation, the sequences are not required to be displayed with
# a visual indication of an error (such as dotted circles). Implementation
# should try their best to display them as normal text, perhaps in the same
# way or very similar to the way their alternative sequence is displayed.
#
# Only characters and character sequences for which a suitable alternative
# sequence exists are provided. For example, deprecated characters for
# which no suitable alternative exists are not listed. (For a list of
# deprecated characters see the "Deprecated" property defined in the Unicode
# Character Database file "PropList.txt".)
#
# Also, canonically equivalent sequences are not listed, even if one
# sequence is specified to be discouraged or deprecated in the Unicode
# Standard. For example, U+2126 OHM SIGN, which is canonically equivalent
# to U+03A9 GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA is not explicitly listed, since it is
# expected that conforming Unicode processes would discover the relation
# between the two characters.
#
# Note that some sequences could be considered recursive, in the way that
# the preferred sequence to use may be a subsequence of the "Do Not Emit"
# sequence. This may have implications for some implementations who may want
# to treat the original sequence and its alternative as similar.
#
# This file should not be considered to be comprehensive. It is expected
# that new sequences and categories may be added to or removed from the file
# as the Unicode Standard goes through new releases.
#
# Format:
#    Field 0  A sequence of Unicode code point values
#    Field 1  A replacement sequence of Unicode code point values
#    Field 2  DoNotEmit type of the original character sequence
#
# Field 2 is followed by an optional human-readable comment field.
#
# These are the values used for Field 2:
# Indic_Atomic_Consonant:
#    Sequences that look like an Indic consonant but should be avoided
#    in representing that consonant. For now, these are limited to
#    Devanagari.
# Indic_Consonant_Conjunct:
#    Sequences that look like an Indic conjunct but should be avoided
#    in representing that conjunct. For now, these are limited to
#    Devanagari.
# Indic_Vowel_Letter:
#    Sequences that look like an Indic vowel letter but should be avoided
#    in representing that vowel letter.
# Bengali_Khanda_Ta:
#    Legacy representation of Bengali khanda ta prior to
#    Unicode Version 4.1.
# Malayalam_Chillu:
#    Legacy representation of Malayalam chillus prior to
#    Unicode Version 5.1. Note that the sequence in Field 0 may appear
#    in legitimate Malayalam sequences not related to chillus.
# Tamil_Shrii:
#    Legacy representation of Tamil ligature shri prior to
#    Unicode Version 4.1.
# Dotless_Form:
#    Dotless forms of lowercase Latin i and j followed by a
#    combining dot above.
# Hamza_Form:
#    Sequences containing Arabic hamza above, which should be avoided.
# Precomposed_Form:
#    Sequences for which a precomposed form exists, but without canonical
#    equivalence.
# Deprecated:
#    Characters that are identified in the Unicode Standard as
#    deprecated for which a replacement sequence exists.
# Discouraged:
#    Miscellaneous characters and sequences discouraged in the
#    Unicode Standard.
# Preferred_Spelling:
#    Miscellaneous characters and sequeences for which the Unicode Standard
#    specifies a preferred spelling.
