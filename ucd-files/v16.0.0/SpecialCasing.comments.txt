# Special Casing
#
# This file is a supplement to the UnicodeData.txt file. The data in this file, combined with
# the simple case mappings in UnicodeData.txt, defines the full case mappings
# Lowercase_Mapping (lc), Titlecase_Mapping (tc), and Uppercase_Mapping (uc).
# For compatibility, the UnicodeData.txt file only contains simple case mappings
# for characters where they are one-to-one (and independent of context and language).
#
# For historical reasons, this file also provides additional information about the casing
# of Unicode characters for selected situations when casing is dependent on context or locale.
#
# Note that the preferred mechanism for defining tailored casing operations is
# the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR). For more information, see the
# discussion of case mappings and case algorithms in the Unicode Standard.
#
# All code points not listed in this file that do not have simple case mappings
# in UnicodeData.txt map to themselves.
