# Vertical_Orientation (vo) Property
#
# This file defines the Vertical_Orientation property. See UAX #50:
# Unicode Vertical Text Layout, at http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr50/
#
# The format of the file is two fields separated by a semicolon.
# Field 0: Unicode code point value or range of code point values in
#   hexadecimal form
# Field 1: Vertical_Orientation property value, one of the following:
#   U - Upright, the same orientation as in the code charts
#   R - Rotated 90 degrees clockwise compared to the code charts
#   Tu - Transformed typographically, with fallback to Upright
#   Tr - Transformed typographically, with fallback to Rotated
#
#  - Certain ranges of unassigned code points default to U. These ranges
#      are mostly associated with CJK scripts and punctuation, or with
#      a small number of other scripts which are predominantly Upright.
#      The private use areas also default to U, because of their most
#      common use for CJK. In the following list of explicit code points
#      and ranges, all unassigned code points default to U:
#         Canadian Syllabics Extended:        U+18B0..U+18FF
