# East_Asian_Width Property
#
# This file is an informative contributory data file in the
# Unicode Character Database.
#
# The format is two fields separated by a semicolon.
# Field 0: Unicode code point value or range of code point values
# Field 1: East_Asian_Width property, consisting of one of the following values:
#         "A", "F", "H", "N", "Na", "W"
#  - All code points, assigned or unassigned, that are not listed
#      explicitly are given the value "N".
#  - The unassigned code points in the following blocks default to "W":
#         CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A: U+3400..U+4DBF
#         CJK Unified Ideographs:             U+4E00..U+9FFF
#         CJK Compatibility Ideographs:       U+F900..U+FAFF
#  - All undesignated code points in Planes 2 and 3, whether inside or
#      outside of allocated blocks, default to "W":
#         Plane 2:                            U+20000..U+2FFFD
#         Plane 3:                            U+30000..U+3FFFD
#
# Character ranges are specified as for other property files in the
# Unicode Character Database.
#
# For legacy reasons, there are no spaces before or after the semicolon
# which separates the two fields. The comments following the number sign
# "#" list the General_Category property value or the L& alias of the
# derived value LC, the Unicode character name or names, and, in lines
# with ranges of code points, the code point count in square brackets.
