# The Script_Extensions property indicates which characters are commonly used
# with a limited number of scripts, but with more than one.
# The property is provisional: values are expected to change over time as more information becomes available.
# For each code point, there is one or more property values.  Each such value is a Script property value.
# For more information, see:
#   UAX #24: http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr24/ and
#   UAX #44: http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/
#
#  All code points not explicitly listed for Script_Extensions
#  have as their value the corresponding Script property value
