# This file provides mappings between Unicode code points and sequences on one hand
# and Shift-JIS codes for cell phone carrier symbols on the other hand.
# Each mapping is symmetric ("round trip"), for equivalent Unicode and carrier
# symbols or sequences. This file does not include best-fit ("fallback")
# mappings to similar but not equivalent symbols in either mapping direction.
#
# Note: It is possible that future versions of this file will include
# additional data columns providing mappings for additional vendors.
#
# Created for Unicode 6.0 by Marcus Scherer.
# Updated for Unicode 6.1 by Ken Whistler.
#
# Format: Semicolon-delimited file with a fixed number of fields.
# The number of fields may increase in the future.
#
# Fields:
# 0: Unicode code point or sequence
# 1: DoCoMo Shift-JIS code
# 2: KDDI Shift-JIS code
# 3: SoftBank Shift-JIS code
#
# Each field 1..3 contains a code if and only if the vendor character set
# has a symbol which is equivalent to the Unicode character or sequence.
