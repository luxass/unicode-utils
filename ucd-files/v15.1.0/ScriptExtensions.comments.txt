# The Script_Extensions property indicates which characters are commonly used
# with more than one script, but with a limited number of scripts.
# For each code point, there is one or more property values.  Each such value is a Script property value.
# For more information, see:

#
# Each Script_Extensions value in this file consists of a set
# of one or more abbreviated Script property values. The ordering of the
# values in that set is not material, but for stability in presentation
# it is given here as alphabetical.
#
# The Script_Extensions values are presented in sorted order in the file.
# They are sorted first by the number of Script property values in their sets,
# and then alphabetically by first differing Script property value.
#
# Following each distinct Script_Extensions value is the list of code
# points associated with that value, listed in code point order.
#
# All code points not explicitly listed for Script_Extensions
# have as their value the corresponding Script property value
