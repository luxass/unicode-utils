# ================================================

# Derived Property:   Numeric_Value
#  Field 1:
#    The values are based on field 8 of UnicodeData.txt, plus the fields
#    kAccountingNumeric, kOtherNumeric, kPrimaryNumeric in the Unicode Han Database (Unihan).
#    The derivations for these values are as follows.
#      Numeric_Value = the value of kAccountingNumeric, kOtherNumeric, or kPrimaryNumeric, if they exist; otherwise
#      Numeric_Value = the value of field 8, if it exists; otherwise
#      Numeric_Value = NaN
#  Field 2:
#    This field is empty; it used to be a copy of the numeric type.
#
#  Field 3:
#    This field was added to this extracted data as of Unicode 5.1.0,
#    expressing the same numeric value either as a whole integer
#    where possible, or as a rational fraction such as "1/6".
#
# WARNING: Certain values, such as 0.16666667, are repeating fractions.
# Although they are only printed with a limited number of decimal places
# in this file, they should be expressed to the limits of the precision
# available when used.
