# Line_Break Property
#
# This file is a normative contributory data file in the
# Unicode Character Database.
#
# The format is two fields separated by a semicolon.
# Field 0: Unicode code point value or range of code point values
# Field 1: Line_Break property, consisting of one of the following values:
#   Non-tailorable:
#         "BK", "CM", "CR", "GL", "LF", "NL", "SP", "WJ", "ZW", "ZWJ"
#   Tailorable:
#         "AI", "AL", "B2", "BA", "BB", "CB", "CJ", "CL", "CP", "EB",
#         "EM", "EX", "H2", "H3", "HL", "HY", "ID", "IN", "IS", "JL",
#         "JT", "JV", "NS", "NU", "OP", "PO", "PR", "QU", "RI", "SA",
#         "SG", "SY", "XX"
#  - All code points, assigned and unassigned, that are not listed
#      explicitly are given the value "XX".
#  - The unassigned code points in the following blocks default to "ID":
#         CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A: U+3400..U+4DBF
#         CJK Unified Ideographs:             U+4E00..U+9FFF
#         CJK Compatibility Ideographs:       U+F900..U+FAFF
#  - All undesignated code points in Planes 2 and 3, whether inside or
#      outside of allocated blocks, default to "ID":
#         Plane 2:                            U+20000..U+2FFFD
#         Plane 3:                            U+30000..U+3FFFD
#  - All unassigned code points in the following Plane 1 ranges, whether
#      inside or outside of allocated blocks, also default to "ID":
#         Plane 1 range:                      U+1F000..U+1FAFF
#         Plane 1 range:                      U+1FC00..U+1FFFD
#  - The unassigned code points in the following block default to "PR":
#         Currency Symbols:                   U+20A0..U+20CF
#
# Character ranges are specified as for other property files in the
# Unicode Character Database.
#
# For legacy reasons, there are no spaces before or after the semicolon
# which separates the two fields. The comments following the number sign
# "#" list the General_Category property value or the L& alias of the
# derived value LC, the Unicode character name or names, and, in lines
# with ranges of code points, the code point count in square brackets.
#
