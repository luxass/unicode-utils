# This file is a normative contributory data file in the
# Unicode Character Database.
#
# This file defines the formal name aliases for Unicode characters.
#
# For informative aliases, see NamesList.txt
#
# The formal name aliases are divided into five types, each with a distinct label.
#
# Type Labels:
#
# 1. correction
#      Corrections for serious problems in the character names
# 2. control
#      ISO 6429 names for C0 and C1 control functions, and other
#      commonly occurring names for control codes
# 3. alternate
#      A few widely used alternate names for format characters
# 4. figment
#      Several documented labels for C1 control code points which
#      were never actually approved in any standard
# 5. abbreviation
#      Commonly occurring abbreviations (or acronyms) for control codes,
#      format characters, spaces, and variation selectors
#
# The formal name aliases are part of the Unicode character namespace, which
# includes the character names and the names of named character sequences.
# The inclusion of ISO 6429 names and other commonly occurring names and
# abbreviations for control codes and format characters as formal name aliases
# is to help avoid name collisions between Unicode character names and the
# labels which commonly appear in text and/or in implementations such as regex, for
# control codes (which for historical reasons have no Unicode character name)
# or for format characters.
#
# For documentation, see NamesList.html and https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/
#
# FORMAT
#
# Each line has three fields, as described here:
#
# First field:  Code point
# Second field: Alias
# Third field:  Type
#
# The type labels used are defined above. As for property values, comparisons
# of type labels should ignore case.
#
# The type labels can be mapped to other strings for display, if desired.
#
# In case multiple aliases are assigned, additional aliases
# are provided on separate lines. Parsers of this data file should
# take note that the same code point can (and does) occur more than once.
#
# Note that currently the only instances of multiple aliases of the same
# type for a single code point are either of type "control" or "abbreviation".
# An alias of type "abbreviation" can, in principle, be added for any code
# point, although currently aliases of type "correction" do not have
# any additional aliases of type "abbreviation". Such relationships
# are not enforced by stability policies.
