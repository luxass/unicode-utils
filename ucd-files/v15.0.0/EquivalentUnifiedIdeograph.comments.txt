# This file defines the following property:
#
# Equivalent_Unified_Ideograph
#
# This data file lists CJK radicals and CJK strokes (aka characters
# that have the Radical=Yes property or are in the CJK Strokes block)
# for which there are reasonably equivalent CJK unified ideographs in
# that they are visually identical or near-identical.
#
# The file contains a list of lines with mappings from one code point
# or code point range to an equivalent CJK unified ideograph.
#
# Each mapping line contains two fields, separated by a semicolon (';').
# The first field contains a code point or code point range represented
# as a variable-length hexadecimal value with 4 to 6 digits. The second
# field contains a code point represented as a variable-length
# hexadecimal value with 4 to 6 digits.
#
# CJK radicals and CJK strokes for which no reasonably equivalent CJK
# unified ideographs exist are listed as comments at the end of the file.
#
# Formally, the default value of the Equivalent_Unified_Ideograph
# property for each code point is <none>, unless a mapping to some
# other character is specified in this data file. When a code point
# has the default value for the Equivalent_Unified_Ideograph property,
# that means that no other character exists whose representative glyph
# is a reasonably equivalent CJK unified ideograph.
