# Special Casing Properties
#
# This file is a supplement to the UnicodeData file.
# It contains additional information about the casing of Unicode characters.
# (For compatibility, the UnicodeData.txt file only contains case mappings for
# characters where they are 1-1, and independent of context and language.
# For more information, see the discussion of Case Mappings in the Unicode Standard.
#
# All code points not listed in this file that do not have a simple case mappings
# in UnicodeData.txt map to themselves.

# Format
# ================================================================================
# The entries in this file are in the following machine-readable format:
#
# <code>; <lower> ; <title> ; <upper> ; (<condition_list> ;)? # <comment>
#
# <code>, <lower>, <title>, and <upper> provide character values in hex. If there is more
# than one character, they are separated by spaces. Other than as used to separate 
# elements, spaces are to be ignored.
#
# The <condition_list> is optional. Where present, it consists of one or more language IDs
# or contexts, separated by spaces. In these conditions:
# - A condition list overrides the normal behavior if all of the listed conditions are true.
# - The context is always the context of the characters in the original string,
#   NOT in the resulting string.
# - Case distinctions in the condition list are not significant.
# - Conditions preceded by "Not_" represent the negation of the condition.
# The condition list is not represented in the UCD as a formal property.
#
# A language ID is defined by BCP 47, with '-' and '_' treated equivalently.
#
# A context for a character C is defined by Section 3.13 Default Case 
# Algorithms, of The Unicode Standard, Version 6.3.
# (This is identical to the context defined by Unicode 4.1.0,
#  as specified in http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.1.0/)
#
# Parsers of this file must be prepared to deal with future additions to this format:
#  * Additional contexts
#  * Additional fields
