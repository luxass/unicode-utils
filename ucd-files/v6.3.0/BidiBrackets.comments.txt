# Bidi_Paired_Bracket is a normative property of type Miscellaneous,
# which establishes a mapping between characters that are treated as
# bracket pairs by the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm.
#
# Bidi_Paired_Bracket_Type is a normative property of type Enumeration,
# which classifies characters into opening and closing paired brackets
# for the purposes of the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm.
#
# This file lists the set of code points with Bidi_Paired_Bracket_Type
# property values Open and Close. The set is derived from the character
# properties General_Category (gc), Bidi_Class (bc), Bidi_Mirrored (Bidi_M),
# and Bidi_Mirroring_Glyph (bmg), as follows: two characters, A and B,
# form a bracket pair if A has gc=Ps and B has gc=Pe, both have bc=ON and
# Bidi_M=Y, and bmg of A is B. Bidi_Paired_Bracket (bpb) maps A to B and
# vice versa, and their Bidi_Paired_Bracket_Type (bpt) property values are
# Open (o) and Close (c), respectively.
#
# For legacy reasons, the characters U+FD3E ORNATE LEFT PARENTHESIS and
# U+FD3F ORNATE RIGHT PARENTHESIS do not mirror in bidirectional display
# and therefore do not form a bracket pair.
#
# The Unicode property value stability policy guarantees that characters
# which have bpt=o or bpt=c also have bc=ON and Bidi_M=Y. As a result, an
# implementation can optimize the lookup of the Bidi_Paired_Bracket_Type
# property values Open and Close by restricting the processing to characters
# with bc=ON.
#
# The format of the file is three fields separated by a semicolon.
# Field 0: Unicode code point value, represented as a hexadecimal value
# Field 1: Bidi_Paired_Bracket property value, a code point value or <none>
# Field 2: Bidi_Paired_Bracket_Type property value, one of the following:
#   o Open
#   c Close
#   n None
# The names of the characters in field 0 are given in comments at the end
# of each line.
#
