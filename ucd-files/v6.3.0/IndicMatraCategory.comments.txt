# This file defines the following provisional property:
#
#    Indic_Matra_Category     enumerated property
#
# NB: Provisional properties and data files have no associated stability
# guarantees. They are provided in part to determine the possible usefulness
# of a property or other data and to encourage analysis and further investigation
# which may result in their improvement. Provisional properties and
# data files may change arbitrarily, or may even be removed in a future version of the
# Unicode Character Database, if they prove not to be useful.
#
# Scope: This provisional property is aimed at the problem of
# the specification of syllabic structure for Indic scripts.
# Because dependent vowels (and visible viramas, where they occur)
# are placed in notional slots around the consonant (or consonant
# cluster) core of an Indic syllable, there may be cooccurrence
# constraints or other interactions. Also, it may be desirable,
# in cases where more than one dependent vowel may occur in
# sequence, as for example, in a top slot and a bottom slot, to
# specify preferred orders for spelling. As such, this property
# is designed primarily to supplement the Indic_Syllabic_Category
# property.
#
# Note that this provisional property is *not* intended as
# a prescriptive property regarding display or font design,
# for a number of reasons. Good font design requires information
# that is outside the context of a character encoding standard,
# and is best handled in other venues. For Indic dependent
# vowels, in particular:
#
#   1. Matra placement may vary somewhat based on typeface design.
#   2. Matra placement, even within a single script, may vary
#      somewhat according to historic period or local conventions.
#   3. Matra placement may be changed by explicit orthographic reform
#      decisions.
#   4. Matras may ligate in various ways with a consonant (or even
#      other elements of a syllable) instead of occurring in a
#      discrete location.
#   4. Matra display may be contextually determined. This is
#      notable, for example, in the Tamil script, where the shape
#      and placement of -u and -uu vowels depends strongly on
#      which consonant they adjoin.
#
# Format:
#    Field 0  Code Point or Code Point Range
#    Field 1  Indic_Matra_Category
#
# A comment field shows General_Category property values and character names.
#
# The scripts assessed as containing dependent vowels or viramas in the
# structural sense used for the Indic_Matra_Category are:
#
# Devanagari, Bengali, Gurmukhi, Gujarati, Oriya, Tamil, Telugu,
# Kannada, Malayalam, Sinhala, Thai, Lao, Tibetan, Myanmar,
# Tagalog, Hanunoo, Buhid, Tagbanwa, Khmer, Limbu, New Tai Lue,
# Buginese, Tai Tham, Balinese, Sundanese, Batak, Lepcha,
# Syloti Nagri, Saurashtra, Rejang, Javanese, Cham, Tai Viet,
# Meetei Mayek, Kharoshthi, Brahmi, Kaithi, Chakma, Sharada, Takri
#
# All characters for all other scripts not in that list
# take the default value for this property.
#
# See IndicSyllabicCategory.txt for a slightly more extended
# list of Indic scripts, including those which do not have
# dependent vowel characters. Currently, those additional
# Indic scripts without dependent vowel characters are
# Tai Le, Phags-pa, and Kayah Li.
