# This file defines the following provisional property:
#
#    Indic_Syllabic_Category     enumerated property
#
# NB: Provisional properties and data files have no associated stability
# guarantees. They are provided in part to determine the possible usefulness
# of a property or other data and to encourage analysis and further investigation
# which may result in their improvement. Provisional properties and
# data files may change arbitrarily, or may even be removed in a future version of the
# Unicode Character Database, if they prove not to be useful.
#
# Scope: This provisional property is aimed at two general problem
# areas involving the analysis and processing of Indic scripts:
#
#   1. Specification of syllabic structure.
#   2. Specification of segmentation rules.
#
# Both of these problem areas may benefit from having defined subtypes
# of Indic script characters which are relevant to how Indic
# syllables (or aksaras) are constructed. Note that rules for
# syllabic structure in Indic scripts may differ significantly
# from how phonological syllables are defined. 
#
# Format:
#    Field 0  Code Point or Code Point Range
#    Field 1  Indic_Syllabic_Category
#
# A comment field shows General_Category property values and character names.
#
# The scripts assessed as Indic in the
# structural sense used for the Indic_Syllabic_Category are:
#
# Devanagari, Bengali, Gurmukhi, Gujarati, Oriya, Tamil, Telugu,
# Kannada, Malayalam, Sinhala, Thai, Lao, Tibetan, Myanmar,
# Tagalog, Hanunoo, Buhid, Tagbanwa, Khmer, Limbu, Tai Le, New Tai Lue,

# Syloti Nagri, Phags-Pa, Saurashtra, Kayah Li, Rejang, Javanese, Cham, Tai Viet,
# Meetei Mayek, Kharoshthi, Brahmi, Kaithi, Chakma, Sharada, Takri
#
# All characters for all other scripts not in that list
# take the default value for this property, unless they
# are individually listed in this data file.
