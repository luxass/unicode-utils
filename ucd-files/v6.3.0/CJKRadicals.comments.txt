# Mapping from radical numbers to characters.
#
# This data file provides a mapping from the radical numbers used
# in the kRSUnicode property to the corresponding character
# in the Kangxi Radicals block or the CJK Radicals Supplement block, as
# well as to a CJK unified ideograph which is formed from that radical
# only.
#
# There is one line per radical number. Each line contains three
# fields, separated by a semicolon (';'). The first field is the
# radical number. The second field is the CJK radical character. The third
# field is the CJK unified ideograph.
#
# Radical numbers match the regular expression [1-9][0-9]{0,2}?'?
# and in particular they can end with a U+0027 ' APOSTROPHE.
