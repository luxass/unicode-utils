#
# This file defines the formal name aliases for Unicode characters.
#
# For informative aliases see NamesList.txt
#
# The formal name aliases are divided into five types.
#
# 1. Corrections for serious problems in the character names
# 2. ISO 6429 names for C0 and C1 control functions, and other
#    commonly occurring names for control codes
# 3. A few widely used alternate names for format characters
# 4. Several documented labels for C1 control code points which
#    were never actually approved in any standard
# 5. Commonly occurring abbreviations (or acronyms) for control codes,
#    format characters, spaces, and variation selectors
#
# The formal name aliases are part of the Unicode character namespace, which
# includes the character names and the names of named character sequences.
# The inclusion of ISO 6429 names and other commonly occurring names and
# abbreviations for control codes and format characters as formal name aliases
# is to help avoid name collisions between Unicode character names and the 
# labels which commonly appear in text and/or in implementations such as regex, for
# control codes (which have no Unicode character name) or for format characters.
#
# For documentation, see NamesList.html and http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/
#
# FORMAT
#
# Each line has three fields, as described here:
#
# First field:  Code point
# Second field: Alias
# Third field:  Type
#
# The Type labels used are: correction, control, alternate, figment, abbreviation
#
# Those Type labels can be mapped to other strings for display, if desired.
#
# In case multiple aliases are assigned, additional aliases
# are provided on separate lines. Parsers of this data file should
# take note that the same code point can (and does) occur more than once.
