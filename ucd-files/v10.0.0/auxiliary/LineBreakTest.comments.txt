# Default Line_Break Test
#
# Format:
# <string> (# <comment>)?
#  <string> contains hex Unicode code points, with
#	÷ wherever there is a break opportunity, and
#	× wherever there is not.
#  <comment> the format can change, but currently it shows:
#	- the sample character name
#	- (x) the Line_Break property value for the sample character
#	- [x] the rule that determines whether there is a break or not,
#	   as listed in the Rules section of LineBreakTest.html
#
# Note:
#  The Line_Break tests use tailoring of numbers described in
#  Example 7 of Section 8.2, "Examples of Customization" of UAX #14.
#
# These samples may be extended or changed in the future.
