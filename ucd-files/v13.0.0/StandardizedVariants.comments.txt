# Specification of the variation sequences that are defined in the
# Unicode Standard.
#
# This file is a normative contributory data file in the
# Unicode Character Database.
#
# Standardized variation sequences are defined in this file.
#
# Ideographic variation sequences are defined according to the registration
# process specified in UTS #37, and are listed in the Ideographic
# Variation Database.
#
# Emoji variation sequences are defined in the file
# emoji-variation-sequences.txt, documented in UTS #51, Unicode Emoji.
#
# Only those three types of variation sequences
# are sanctioned for use by conformant implementations.
# In all other cases, use of a variation selector character does
# not change the visual appearance of the preceding base character
# from what it would have had in the absence of the variation selector.
#
# For more information on standardized variation sequences,
# see Section 23.4, Variation Selectors,
# in The Unicode Standard, Version 13.0.
#
# For more information on the Ideographic Variation Database,

#
# Format:
#   Field 0: the variation sequence
#   Field 1: the description of the desired appearance
#   Field 2: where the appearance is only different in particular shaping environments
#	this field lists them. The possible values are: isolate, initial, medial, final.
#	If more than one is present, there are spaces between them.
# =============================
# Mathematical
# The following two entries were originally defined for Unicode 3.2
# but were determined to be in error and were removed from the list
# of standardized variation sequences. The entries are left commented out
# in the file for the historical record of changes made to the data.
#2278 FE00; with vertical stroke; # NEITHER LESS-THAN NOR GREATER-THAN
#2279 FE00; with vertical stroke; # NEITHER GREATER-THAN NOR LESS-THAN
# East Asian punctuation positional variants
# Myanmar
# Phags-pa
# Manichaean
# Mongolian
# CJK compatibility ideographs
# Note: In the entries for CJK compatibility ideographs, field 1
# has the name of the respective CJK compatibility
# ideograph. The visual appearance of that CJK compatibility ideograph
# is the intended visual appearance of the base CJK unified ideograph
# followed by the variation selector in each sequence defined.
