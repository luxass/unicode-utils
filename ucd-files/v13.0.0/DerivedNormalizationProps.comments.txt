# Derived Property: FC_NFKC_Closure  (DEPRECATED as of Unicode 6.0.0)
#  Generated from computing: b = NFKC(Fold(a)); c = NFKC(Fold(b));
#  Then if (c != b) add the mapping from a to c to the set of
#  mappings that constitute the FC_NFKC_Closure list
#  Uses the full case folding from CaseFolding.txt, without the T option.
