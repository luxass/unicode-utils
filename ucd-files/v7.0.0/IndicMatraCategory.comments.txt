# This file defines the following provisional property:
#
#    Indic_Matra_Category     enumerated property
#
# NB: Provisional properties and data files have no associated stability
# guarantees. They are provided in part to determine the possible usefulness
# of a property or other data and to encourage analysis and further investigation
# which may result in their improvement. Provisional properties and data files
# may change arbitrarily, or may even be removed in a future version of the
# Unicode Character Database, if they prove not to be useful.
#
# Scope: This provisional property is aimed at the problem of
# the specification of syllabic structure for Indic scripts.
# Because dependent vowels (and visible viramas, where they occur)
# are placed in notional slots around the consonant (or consonant
# cluster) core of an Indic syllable, there may be cooccurrence
# constraints or other interactions. Also, it may be desirable,
# in cases where more than one dependent vowel may occur in
# sequence, as for example, in a top slot and a bottom slot, to
# specify preferred orders for spelling. As such, this property
# is designed primarily to supplement the Indic_Syllabic_Category
# property.
#
# Note that this provisional property is *not* intended as
# a prescriptive property regarding display or font design,
# for a number of reasons. Good font design requires information
# that is outside the context of a character encoding standard,
# and is best handled in other venues. For Indic dependent
# vowels, in particular:
#
#   1. Matra placement may vary somewhat based on typeface design.
#   2. Matra placement, even within a single script, may vary
#      somewhat according to historic period or local conventions.
#   3. Matra placement may be changed by explicit orthographic reform
#      decisions.
#   4. Matras may ligate in various ways with a consonant (or even
#      other elements of a syllable) instead of occurring in a
#      discrete location.
#   5. Matra display may be contextually determined. This is
#      notable, for example, in the Tamil script, where the shape
#      and placement of -u and -uu vowels depends strongly on
#      which consonant they adjoin.
#
# Format:
#    Field 0  Unicode code point value or range of code point values
#    Field 1  Indic_Matra_Category property value
#
# Field 1 is followed by a comment field, starting with the number sign '#',
# which shows the General_Category property value, the Unicode character name
# or names, and, in lines with ranges of code points, the code point count in
# square brackets.
#
# The scripts assessed as containing dependent vowels or viramas in the
# structural sense used for the Indic_Matra_Category are the following:
#
# Balinese, Batak, Bengali, Brahmi, Buginese, Buhid, Chakma, Cham,
# Devanagari, Grantha, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Hanunoo, Javanese, Kaithi,
# Kannada, Kharoshthi, Khmer, Khojki, Khudawadi, Lao, Lepcha, Limbu,
# Malayalam, Meetei Mayek, Modi, Myanmar, New Tai Lue, Oriya, Rejang,
# Saurashtra, Sharada, Siddham, Sinhala, Sundanese, Syloti Nagri,
# Tagalog, Tagbanwa, Tai Tham, Tai Viet, Takri, Tamil, Telugu, Thai,
# Tibetan, and Tirhuta.
#
# All characters for all other scripts not in that list
# take the default value for this property.
#
# See IndicSyllabicCategory.txt for a slightly more extended
# list of Indic scripts, including those which do not have
# dependent vowel characters. Currently, those additional
# Indic scripts without dependent vowel characters are
# Kayah Li, Mahajani, Phags-pa, and Tai Le.
