# Field 1: East_Asian_Width property, consisting of one of the following values:
#         "N", "A", "H", "W", "F", "Na"
#  - All code points, assigned or unassigned, that are not listed
#         explicitly are given the value "N".
# The unassigned code points that default to "W" include ranges in the
# following blocks:
#     CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A:       U+3400..U+4DBF
#     CJK Unified Ideographs:                   U+4E00..U+9FFF

#                                              U+30000..U+3FFFD
#  - Character ranges are specified as for other property files in
#         the Unicode Character Database.
#
# For legacy reasons, there are no spaces before or after the semicolon
# which separates the two fields. The comments following the number sign
# "#" list the General_Category property value or the L& alias of the
# derived value LC, the Unicode character name or names, and, in lines
# with ranges of code points, the code point count in square brackets.
