# Default Line Break Test
#
# Format:
# <string> (# <comment>)? 
#  <string> contains hex Unicode code points, with 
#	รท wherever there is a break opportunity, and 
#	ร wherever there is not.
#  <comment> the format can change, but currently it shows:
#	- the sample character name
#	- (x) the Line_Break property value for the sample character
#	- [x] the rule that determines whether there is a break or not
# Note: The Line Break tests use tailoring of numbers described in Example 7 of Section 8.2 Examples of Customization.
# They also differ from the results produced by a pair table implementation in sequences like: ZW SP CL.
#
# These samples may be extended or changed in the future.
