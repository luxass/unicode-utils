#
# This data file lists characters that have the mirrored property
# where there is another Unicode character that typically has a glyph
# that is the mirror image of the original character's glyph.
# The repertoire covered by the file is Unicode 4.1.0.
# 
# The file contains a list of lines with mappings from one code point
# to another one for character-based mirroring.
# Note that for "real" mirroring, a rendering engine needs to select
# appropriate alternative glyphs, and that many Unicode characters do not
# have a mirror-image Unicode character.
# 
# Each mapping line contains two fields, separated by a semicolon (';').
# Each of the two fields contains a code point represented as a
# variable-length hexadecimal value with 4 to 6 digits.
# A comment indicates where the characters are "BEST FIT" mirroring.
# 
# Code points with the "mirrored" property but no appropriate mirrors are
# listed as comments at the end of the file.
# 
# For information on bidi mirroring, see UAX #9: Bidirectional Algorithm,
# at http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr9/
