# This file provides a conformance test for implementations of the
# Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm, specified in UAX #9: Unicode
# Bidirectional Algorithm, at http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/
#
# The test data has been generated with a few constraints. Each test case
# is a single paragraph, so the test data does not contain any characters
# with Bidi_Class property value Paragraph_Separator and rule P1 of the
# algorithm is out of scope. Each test case further constitutes a single
# line of text; reordering is applied within a single line and independently
# of a rendering engine, and rules L3 and L4 are also out of scope.
# Therefore, the test data can be used for verifying conformance to the
# Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm implemented through rule L2 inclusively.
#
# The file contains test sequences of explicit character code points.
# Each line consists of five fields separated by a semicolon.
#
# Field 0: A sequence of hexadecimal code point values separated by space
# Field 1: A value representing the paragraph direction, as follows:
#   0 represents left-to-right
#   1 represents right-to-left
#   2 represents auto-LTR according to rules P2 and P3 of the algorithm
# Field 2: The resolved paragraph embedding level
# Field 3: A list of resolved levels; characters removed in rule X9 are
#   indicated with an 'x'
# Field 4: A list of indices showing the resulting visual ordering from
#   left to right; characters with a resolved level of 'x' are skipped
#
# Comment lines start with '#'.
