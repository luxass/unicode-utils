# This file defines the following property:
#
#    Indic_Syllabic_Category     enumerated property
#
# Scope: This property is aimed at two general problem
# areas involving the analysis and processing of Indic scripts:
#
#   1. Specification of syllabic structure.
#   2. Specification of segmentation rules.
#
# Both of these problem areas may benefit from having defined subtypes
# of Indic script characters which are relevant to how Indic
# syllables (or aksaras) are constructed. Note that rules for
# syllabic structure in Indic scripts may differ significantly
# from how phonological syllables are defined.
#
# Format:
#    Field 0  Unicode code point value or range of code point values
#    Field 1  Indic_Syllabic_Category property value
#
# Field 1 is followed by a comment field, starting with the number sign '#',
# which shows the General_Category property value, the Unicode character name
# or names, and, in lines with ranges of code points, the code point count in
# square brackets.
#
# The scripts assessed as Indic in the structural sense used for the
# Indic_Syllabic_Category are the following:
#
# Ahom, Balinese, Batak, Bengali, Bhaiksuki, Brahmi, Buginese, Buhid,
# Chakma, Cham, Devanagari, Dogra, Grantha, Gujarati, Gunjala Gondi,
# Gurmukhi, Hanunoo, Javanese, Kaithi, Kannada, Kayah Li, Kharoshthi,
# Khmer, Khojki, Khudawadi, Lao, Lepcha, Limbu, Mahajani, Makasar,
# Malayalam, Marchen, Masaram Gondi, Meetei Mayek, Modi, Multani,
# Myanmar, Nandinagari, Newa, New Tai Lue, Oriya, Phags-pa, Rejang,
# Saurashtra, Sharada, Siddham, Sinhala, Soyombo, Sundanese, Syloti
# Nagri, Tagalog, Tagbanwa, Tai Le, Tai Tham, Tai Viet, Takri, Tamil,
# Telugu, Thai, Tibetan, Tirhuta, and Zanabazar Square.
#
# All characters for all other scripts not in that list
# take the default value for this property, unless they
# are individually listed in this data file.

# ================================================
# Property: Indic_Syllabic_Category

#  All code points not explicitly listed for Indic_Syllabic_Category
#  have the value Other.

# Indic_Syllabic_Category=Bindu
# Bindu/Anusvara (nasalization or -n)
# [Not derivable]
# ================================================
# Indic_Syllabic_Category=Visarga
# Visarga (-h)
# Excludes letters for jihvamuliya and upadhmaniya, which are
#   related, but structured somewhat differently.
# [Not derivable]
# ================================================
# Indic_Syllabic_Category=Avagraha
# Avagraha (elision of initial a- in sandhi)
# [Not derivable]
# ================================================
# Indic_Syllabic_Category=Nukta
# Nukta (diacritic for borrowed consonants or other consonant
# modifications). Note that while the resulting sound is typically a
# consonant, the base letter a nukta follows may be an independent
# vowel. For example, <U+0A85 GUJARATI LETTER A, U+0AFD GUJARATI
# SIGN THREE-DOT NUKTA ABOVE> is used to transcribe ARABIC LETTER
# AIN.
# [Not derivable]
# ================================================
# Indic_Syllabic_Category=Virama
# Virama (killing of inherent vowel in consonant sequence
#         or consonant stacker)
# Only includes characters that can act both as visible killer viramas
# and consonant stackers. Separate property values exist for characters
# that can only act as pure killers or only as consonant stackers.
# [Derivation: (ccc=9) - (InSC=Pure_Killer) - (InSC=Invisible_Stacker)
#  - (InSC=Number_Joiner) - 2D7F]

# Indic_Syllabic_Category=Invisible_Stacker
# Invisible stacker (invisible consonant stacker virama).
#
# Note that in some scripts, such as Kharoshthi and Masaram Gondi, an invisible
# stacker may have a second function, changing the shape and/or location of the
# consonant preceding it, even when there is no consonant following the
# invisible stacker.
# [Not derivable]

# This includes generic placeholders used for
# Indic script layout (NBSP and dotted circle), as well as a few script-
# specific vowel-holder characters which are not technically
# consonants, but serve instead as bases for placement of vowel marks.

# TAI THAM THAM DIGIT THREE using an invisible stacker.
