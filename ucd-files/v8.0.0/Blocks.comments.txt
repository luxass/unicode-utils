# Format:
# Start Code..End Code; Block Name

# ================================================

# Note:   When comparing block names, casing, whitespace, hyphens,
#         and underbars are ignored.
#         For example, "Latin Extended-A" and "latin extended a" are equivalent.
#         For more information on the comparison of property values, 
#            see UAX #44: http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/
#
#  All block ranges start with a value where (cp MOD 16) = 0,
#  and end with a value where (cp MOD 16) = 15. In other words,
#  the last hexadecimal digit of the start of range is ...0 
#  and the last hexadecimal digit of the end of range is ...F.
#  This constraint on block ranges guarantees that allocations
#  are done in terms of whole columns, and that code chart display
#  never involves splitting columns in the charts.
#
#  All code points not explicitly listed for Block
#  have the value No_Block.
