# Standardized variation sequences are defined in this file.
# Ideographic variation sequences are defined acording to the registration
# process specified in UTS #37, and are listed in the Ideographic
# Variation Database. Only those two types of variation sequences
# are sanctioned for use by conformant implementations.
# In all other cases, use of a variation selector character does
# not change the visual appearance of the preceding base character
# from what it would have had in the absence of the variation selector.
#
# For more information on standardized variation sequences, 
# see Section 16.4, Variation Selectors, 
# in The Unicode Standard, Version 5.0.

# Format:
#   Field 0: the variation sequence
#   Field 1: the description of the desired appearance
#   Field 2: where the appearance is only different in in particular shaping environments
#	this field lists them. The possible values are: isolate, initial, medial, final.
#	If more than one is present, there are spaces between them.
