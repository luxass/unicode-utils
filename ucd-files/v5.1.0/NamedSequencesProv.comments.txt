# Provisional Named Sequences
# Note: This data file contains those named
#   sequences which have been designated to be provisional,
#   rather than fully approved.
#
# Format:
# Name of Sequence; Code Point Sequence for USI
#
# Note: The order of entries in this file is not significant.
# However, entries are generally in script order corresponding
# to block order in the Unicode Standard, to make it easier
# to find entries currently in the list.
# ================================================
# Provisional entries for NamedSequences.txt.
# Proposed additions for Tamil. 2007-10-19
#
# These Tamil named sequences have been accepted for a future
# version of the Unicode Standard. 2008-02-08
#
# All of the Tamil named sequences will be moved to
# the approved NamedSequences.txt, once the required
# synchronization with the normative clause of ISO/IEC 10646
# has been completed, through the ISO ballotting process.
#
# A visual display of the Tamil named sequences is available
# in the documentation for Unicode 5.1. See:
# http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.1.0/

# the sequence, based on the Lithuanian additions accepted
# for Unicode 5.0.
