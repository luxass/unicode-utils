# Provisional entries for NamedSequences.txt.

# Proposed additions for Tamil. 2007-10-19
#
# These Tamil named sequences have been accepted for a future
# version of the Unicode Standard. 2008-02-08
#
# All of the Tamil named sequences will be moved to
# the approved NamedSequences.txt, once the required
# synchronization with the normative clause of ISO/IEC 10646
# has been completed, through the ISO ballotting process.
#
# A visual display of the Tamil named sequences is available
# in the documentation for Unicode 5.1. See:
