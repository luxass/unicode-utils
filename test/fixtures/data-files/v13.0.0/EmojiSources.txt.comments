# This file provides historical mappings between Unicode code points and sequences on one hand
# and Shift-JIS codes for cell phone carrier symbols on the other hand.
# Each mapping is symmetric ("round trip"), for equivalent Unicode and carrier
# symbols or sequences. This file does not include best-fit ("fallback")
# mappings to similar but not equivalent symbols in either mapping direction.
# Created for Unicode 6.0 by Markus Scherer.
# Updated for subsequent versions by Ken Whistler (no changes to mappings).
# Format: Semicolon-delimited file with a fixed number of fields.
# Note that the format, including the number of fields, may change in the future.
# Fields:
# 0: Unicode code point or sequence
# 1: DoCoMo Shift-JIS code
# 2: KDDI Shift-JIS code
# 3: SoftBank Shift-JIS code
# Each field 1..3 contains a code if and only if the vendor character set
# has a symbol which is equivalent to the Unicode character or sequence.
# ================================================
# Keycap sequences for telephone keypad.
# The following 11 mappings are historical. The combining character sequences
# in these mappings do not include variation selectors for emoji presentation.
# Thus they do not match the named character sequences with keycaps listed in
# NamedSequences.txt.
