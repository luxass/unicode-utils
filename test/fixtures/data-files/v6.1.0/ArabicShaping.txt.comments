# This file defines the Joining_Type and Joining_Group
# property values for Arabic, Syriac, N'Ko, and Mandaic
# positional shaping, repeating in machine readable form the
# information exemplified in Tables 8-3, 8-8, 8-9, 8-10, 8-13, 8-14,
# 8-15, 13-5, 14-5, and 14-6 of The Unicode Standard, Version 6.1.
# See sections 8.2, 8.3, 13.5, and 14.12 of The Unicode Standard, 
# Version 6.1 for more information.
# Each line contains four fields, separated by a semicolon.
# Field 0: the code point, in 4-digit hexadecimal
#   form, of an Arabic, Syriac, N'Ko, or Mandaic character.
# Field 1: gives a short schematic name for that character.
#   The schematic name is descriptive of the shape, based as
#   consistently as possible on a name for the skeleton and
#   then the diacritic marks applied to the skeleton, if any.
#   Note that this schematic name is considered a comment,
#   and does not constitute a formal property value.
# Field 2: defines the joining type (property name: Joining_Type)
#   R Right_Joining
#   L Left_Joining
#   D Dual_Joining
#   C Join_Causing
#   U Non_Joining
#   T Transparent
#     See Section 8.2, Arabic for more information on these types.
# Field 3: defines the joining group (property name: Joining_Group)
# The values of the joining group are based schematically on character
# names. Where a schematic character name consists of two or more parts separated
# by spaces, the formal Joining_Group property value, as specified in
# PropertyValueAliases.txt, consists of the same name parts joined by
# underscores. Hence, the entry:
#   0629; TEH MARBUTA; R; TEH MARBUTA
# corresponds to [Joining_Group = Teh_Marbuta].
# Note: The property value now designated [Joining_Group = Teh_Marbuta_Goal] 
#   used to apply to both of the following characters
#   in earlier versions of the standard:
#   U+06C2 ARABIC LETTER HEH GOAL WITH HAMZA ABOVE
#   U+06C3 ARABIC LETTER TEH MARBUTA GOAL
#   However, it currently applies only to U+06C3, and *not* to U+06C2.
#   To avoid destabilizing existing Joining_Group property aliases, the
#   prior Joining_Group value for U+06C3 (Hamza_On_Heh_Goal) has been
#   retained as a property value alias, despite the fact that it
#   no longer applies to its namesake character, U+06C2.
#   See PropertyValueAliases.txt.
# When other cursive scripts are added to the Unicode Standard in
# the future, the joining group value of all its letters will default
# to jg=No_Joining_Group in this data file. Other, more specific
# joining group values will be defined only if an explicit proposal
# to define those values exactly has been approved by the UTC. This
# is the convention exemplified by the N'Ko and Mandaic scripts. Only the Arabic
# and Syriac scripts currently have explicit joining group values defined.
# Note: Code points that are not explicitly listed in this file are
# either of joining type T or U:
# - Those that not explicitly listed that are of General Category Mn, Me, or Cf
#   have joining type T.
# - All others not explicitly listed have joining type U.
# For an explicit listing of characters of joining type T, see
# the derived property file DerivedJoiningType.txt.
# There are currently no characters of joining type L defined in Unicode.
