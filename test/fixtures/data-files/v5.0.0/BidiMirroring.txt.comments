# Bidi_Mirroring_Glyph Property
# This file is an informative contributory data file in the
# Unicode Character Database.
# Copyright (c) 1991-2006 Unicode, Inc.
# For terms of use, see http://www.unicode.org/terms_of_use.html
# This data file lists characters that have the mirrored property
# where there is another Unicode character that typically has a glyph
# that is the mirror image of the original character's glyph.
# The repertoire covered by the file is Unicode 5.0.0.
# The file contains a list of lines with mappings from one code point
# to another one for character-based mirroring.
# Note that for "real" mirroring, a rendering engine needs to select
# appropriate alternative glyphs, and that many Unicode characters do not
# have a mirror-image Unicode character.
# Each mapping line contains two fields, separated by a semicolon (';').
# Each of the two fields contains a code point represented as a
# variable-length hexadecimal value with 4 to 6 digits.
# A comment indicates where the characters are "BEST FIT" mirroring.
# Code points with the "mirrored" property but no appropriate mirrors are
# listed as comments at the end of the file.
# For information on bidi mirroring, see UAX #9: Bidirectional Algorithm,
# at http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr9/
