# Unicode Named Character Sequences
# This file is a normative contributory data file in the Unicode
# Character Database.
# Copyright (c) 1991-2015 Unicode, Inc.
# For terms of use, see http://www.unicode.org/terms_of_use.html
# Format:
# Name of Sequence; Code Point Sequence for USI
# Code point sequences in the Unicode Character Database
# use spaces as delimiters. The corresponding format for a
# UCS Sequence Identifier (USI) in ISO/IEC 10646 uses
# comma delimitation and angle brackets. Thus, a Unicode
# named character sequence of the form:
# EXAMPLE NAME;1000 1001 1002
# in this data file, would correspond to an ISO/IEC 10646 USI
# as follows:
# <1000, 1001, 1002>
# For more information, see UAX #34: Unicode Named Character
# Sequences, at http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr34/
# Note: The order of entries in this file is not significant.
# However, entries are generally in script order corresponding
# to block order in the Unicode Standard, to make it easier
# to find entries in the list.
