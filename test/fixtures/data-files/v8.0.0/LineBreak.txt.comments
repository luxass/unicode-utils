# Line_Break Property
# This file is a normative contributory data file in the

# The format is two fields separated by a semicolon.
# Field 0: Unicode code point value or range of code point values
# Field 1: Line_Break property, consisting of one of the following values:
#   Normative:
#         "BK", "CR", "LF", "CM", "SG", "GL", "CB", "SP", "ZW",
#         "NL", "WJ", "JL", "JV", "JT", "H2", "H3"
#   Informative:
#         "XX", "OP", "CL", "CP", "QU", "NS", "EX", "SY",
#         "IS", "PR", "PO", "NU", "AL", "ID", "IN", "HY",
#         "BB", "BA", "SA", "AI", "B2", "HL", "CJ", "RI"
#  - All code points, assigned and unassigned, that are not listed
#         explicitly are given the value "XX".
# The unassigned code points that default to "ID" include ranges in the
# following blocks:
#     CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A:       U+3400..U+4DBF
#     CJK Unified Ideographs:                   U+4E00..U+9FFF
#     CJK Compatibility Ideographs:             U+F900..U+FAFF
#     CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B:      U+20000..U+2A6DF
#     CJK Unified Ideographs Extension C:      U+2A700..U+2B73F
#     CJK Unified Ideographs Extension D:      U+2B740..U+2B81F
#     CJK Unified Ideographs Extension E:      U+2B820..U+2CEAF
#     CJK Compatibility Ideographs Supplement: U+2F800..U+2FA1F
#     and any other reserved code points on
#         Planes 2 and 3:                      U+20000..U+2FFFD
#                                              U+30000..U+3FFFD
# The unassigned code points that default to "PR" comprise a range in the
# following block:
#     Currency Symbols:                         U+20A0..U+20CF
#  - Character ranges are specified as for other property files in
#         the Unicode Character Database.
# For legacy reasons, there are no spaces before or after the semicolon
# which separates the two fields. The comments following the number sign
# "#" list the General_Category property value or the L& alias of the
# derived value LC, the Unicode character name or names, and, in lines
# with ranges of code points, the code point count in square brackets.
